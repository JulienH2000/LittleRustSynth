## LittleRustSynth
Useless project to explore audio in Rust. Based on CPAL (cross platform audio library).  
Building a simple digital synthesis software while finding out how to build it.  
  
### *Current features :*
Band-limited synthesis for Sine/Square/Saw/Triangle waves.  
On the fly oscillator config.   
Node architecture, currently providing Oscillator Node and Audio Process Node.   
  
### *Ressources :*
